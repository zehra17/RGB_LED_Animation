# RGB LED Animation

A simple project to create random color animations with an RGB LED and Arduino.

## Components
- RGB LED
- 3 x 330Ω resistors
- Arduino (e.g., Uno)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit
- Connect RGB LED pins (R: D9, G: D10, B: D11) with 330Ω resistors.
- Common pin (Anode) to 5V.

## How to Run
1. Connect components.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino.
3. Enjoy the color animation!

## Improvements
- Add potentiometer to control speed.
